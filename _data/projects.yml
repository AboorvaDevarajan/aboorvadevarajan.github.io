- name: <h3> <strong> Efficient Resource Allocation for Virtual Machine using Particle Swarm Optimization in Cloud Computing Environment  </strong> </h3>
  date: "2015"
  description: <p>This project introduces a method for effectively allocating resources to dynamic virtual machine requests in a cloud environment, taking into account the load balancing of each physical machine. The concept of <b>"skewness"</b> is introduced to quantify the uneven distribution of resource usage across physical machines.</p><p>This project includes the following modules<ul><li> Introduction of the <b>"Skewness Value"</b> as a metric for assessing the load balancing factor of physical machine resources.</li><li> Implementation of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) an approximation based genetic algorithm to find the effective resource allocation.</li></ul></p>

- name: <h3> <strong> Optimal Game of Checkers </strong> </h3>
  date: "2013"
  description: <p> The project focuses on implementing the <b>alpha-beta pruning algorithm</b> to construct a game tree based on the current move in order to predict the optimal move for the machine in checkers. This project consists of the following modules <ul> <li>Generation of an N-ary Game Tree containing all possible states of a checkerboard, using the current board state as input.</li> <li> A <b>utility (payoff/heuristic) function</b> is utilized to determine the value of terminal states.</li> <li>Estimation of the game tree based on heuristic values to identify the best possible move.</li> <li>Parallelization of the game tree generation and search process using <b>Message Passing Interface</b>.</li> </ul> </p>
