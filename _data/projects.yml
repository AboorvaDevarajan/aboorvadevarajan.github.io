- name: <h3> <strong> Efficient Resource Allocation for Virtual Machine using Particle Swarm Optimization in Cloud Computing Environment  </strong> </h3>
  date: "2015"
  description: <p>This project proposes a technique for the efficient resource allocation for dynamic virtual machine requests based on the load balancing factor of each physical machine in the cloud environment. The concept of <b> "skewness" </b> is introduced to measure the unevenness of resource utilization in each physical machine.</p><p>This project includes the following modules<ul><li> Introducing <b>Skewness Value</b> as a <b>Load Balancing Factor of Physical Machine Resources </b></li><li> Implementation of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) an approximation based genetic algorithm to find the effective population.</li></ul></p>

- name: <h3> <strong> Optimal Game of Checkers </strong> </h3>
  date: "2013"
  description: <p> The project aims at the implementation of <b> alpha beta pruning algorithm </b> to generate a game tree using the current move, which is used for predicting the best possible move that can be made by the machine in the game of checkers. </p> <p> This project includes the following modules <ul> <li> Generation of N-ary Game Tree with all possible states of a checker board using the current board state as input. </li> <li> A <b>utility ( payoff / heuristic ) function </b>determines the value of terminal states.</li> <li> Estimation of the game tree based on heuristic values, to find the best possible move.</li> <li> Parallelization of the game tree generation and search process using <b>Message Passing Interface</b>.</li> </ul> </p>
