<h3>Major academic projects I was involved in</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<h3><strong>Optimal Game of Checkers</strong></h3> <a class="btn btn-large btn-info"
href="https://aboorvadevarajan.github.io/Parallel-Checkers-Game/"> Project Page</a>

<p>The project aims at the implementation of <b>alpha beta pruning algorithm </b>to generate a game tree using the current move, which is used for predicting the best possible move that can be made by the machine in the game of checkers.</p>

<p> This project includes the following modules
<ul>
<li> Generation of N-ary Game Tree with all possible states of a checker board using the current board state as input. </li>
<li> A <b>utility ( payoff / heuristic ) function </b>determines the value of terminal states.</li>
<li> Estimation of the game tree based on heuristic values, to find the best possible move.</li>
<li> Parallelization of the game tree generation and search process using <b>Message Passing Interface</b>.</li>
</ul>
</p>
</li>

<h3><strong>Efficient Resource Allocation for Virtual Machine using Particle
Swarm Optimization in Cloud Computing Environment</strong></h3>


<p>This project proposes a technique for the efficient resource allocation for dynamic virtual machine requests
based on the load balancing factor of each physical machine in the cloud environment. The concept of
<b>"
skewness
" </b>is introduced to measure the
unevenness of resource utilization
 in each physical
machine. </p>
<p> This project includes the following modules
<ul>
<li> Introducing <b>Skewness Value</b> as a <b>Load Balancing Factor of Physical Machine Resources </b></li>
<li> Implementation of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) an approximation based genetic algorithm to find the effective population.</li>
</ul>
