<h3>Major academic projects I was involved in</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<h3><strong>Optimal Game of Checkers</strong></h3> <a class="btn btn-large btn-info" 
href="https://aboorvadevarajan.github.io/Parallel-Checkers-Game/"> Project Page</a>
<p>The project aims at alpha beta pruning Artificial Intelligence algorithm implementation for predicting the best possible move that can be made by the machine in the game of checkers.</p>
<p> This project includes the following modules
<ul>
<li> Generation of N-ary Game Tree with all possible states </li>
<li> Developement of an optimal heuristic function </li>
<li> Estimation of the game tree based on heuristic values to find the best possible move</li>
<li> Parallelizing the game tree generation process using Message Passing Interface</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3><strong>Efficient Resource Allocation of Virtual Machines</strong></h3>
<p>This project proposes a the of virtual machine resource allocation based on the load balancing factor of each physical machine in the cloud environment. It introduces the concept of "skewness" to measure the uneveness of the resource utilization in each physical machine. By minimizing the skewness, the server resources can be effectively utilized. Particle Swarm intelligence is used to find the best allocation of the virtual machines therby, minimizing the skewness of resources in each physical machine.</p>
<p> This project includes the following modules
<ul>
<li> Introducing Skewness Value: As a Load Balancing Factor of Physical Machine Resources </li>
<li> Implementation of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) an approximation genetic algorithm to find the efficient population.</li>
</ul>
</li>
