This is my first blog post on Physics: How things work, I’m going to take my first step in putting some effort in brushing up my physics skills by understanding the objects I come across every day and learn how it works. Hope this will pave a way for me to get a real practical knowledge on Physics. Every day when I learn a new concept I’m planning to post it here. (I will mostly post the readings from multiple sources)

**Skating**

Whether you’re gliding across the ice, strapping old roller skates to your shoes, or cruising down the sidewalk on a skateboard. We free ourselves from the friction and move with ease. Like ordinary shoes, skates support you vertically. That is the ground supports the skates and the skates support you. But unlike ordinary shoes, the skates move freely forward and backwards and you can coast.

Coasting is what makes skating so fun. Coasting is also an example of one of the most fundamental principles in all of physics, the principle of inertia.

**What is Inertia?**

An object at rest tends to remain at rest, and an object in motion tends to remain in motion.

**Newton’s first Law of Motion : Law of Inertia**

Newton in his 1st Law of Motion explains about the Inertia also called as “The Law of Inertia”.  A body continues to be in motion if it is moving or will stay at rest if it was initially at rest unless acted upon by external force.

Another definition could be:

**“Every object persists in its state of rest or uniform motion in a straight line unless it is compelled to change that state by forces impressed on it.”**

For instance, a book lying on the table will stay as it is unless someone picks up or moves it by pushing or pulling.


**A day-to-day practical experiment:**

A coin is placed on the card which is again placed on an empty glass as shown in figure. The coin being in rest continues to be in rest, and any changes around it will not affect its position and motion unless the coin comes into direct contact. We are applying force only on the card because of which coin is not affected much and falls into the glass while card moves away.


The same basic law applies in Skating,

    If you’re stationary on a level surface, and nothing pushes you, you’ll remain stationary.
    If you something does push you, you’ll begin to move in the direction of that push.
    If you’re moving on a level surface and nothing pushes on you, you’ll continue moving forward in a straight line.
    If something does push on you, you’ll speed up or slow down or turn.


To understand skating better, let’s examine what’s going on with Skating and try to answer these questions,

    Why does a stationary skater tend to remain stationary?
    Why is a moving skater tend to be moving?
    How can we describe the fluid effortless motion of a coasting skater?
    How does a skater start, stop or, turn?
    Why does a skater need ice or wheels in order to skate?
