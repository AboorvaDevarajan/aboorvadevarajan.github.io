title: World of Paradoxes :)
---

Paradoxes are the observations that contradicts the current rules and are something which are not deemed to be solved till now. Paradoxes excites me in someway, as it always needs a twist in brain to understand it.

I thought it will be really interesting to share some of my favorite paradoxes here. <img src="/images/smile.png">

<h3>Zeno's Paradox - That's number 1 <img src="/images/twist.gif"></h3>

That's one paradox of Zeno a famous greek philosopher on infinite numbers  <img src="/images/smile.png">

The Zeno's paradox can be rephrased in simple words as below,

<img src="/images/zeno_hare.jpg">

If someone wish to cross a bridge of certain length. They must first cover half of the length of the bridge. Again from that point, the half of the remaining length must be covered and so on, to reach the end point of that bridge. 

At this point some may think.  What's a big deal in this? It can be computed.<img src="/images/smirk.gif">

There comes this interesting Zeno's paradox, 

First to cover a distance of 1 meter we must cover half meter, then I must cover half of half meter before I can cover half the remaining  distance, then in turn to cover half of the half meter I must cover half of the half of the half a meter this goes on infinitely, so this shows that we can't cover that one meter distance since infinite number of intermediate number halving steps are involved, thats how Zeno's paradox is explained.

Let us have an example for this,
<br/>
<br/>
To cover a mile one must first cover half the mile, then half of half the mile and so on.

<b><i>1 =  1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + 1/16 + ....... + infinitely large </i></b>
<br/>

Here's a brief insight and resolution to Zeno's paradox, however sum of infinite numbers in mathematics is always depicted to be infinite, but in the case of the above example its always a finite number. The infinite series in the Zeno's paradox is summable to a finite number.

Thus, even though if there are infinitely large intermediate halves exists in between, the result is always a finite sum, in the above case its 1.  <img src="/images/smirk.png" height=30 width=30> <img src="/images/tear_laugh.png" height=30 width=30>
